# # Sometimes it is desirable to let the sender know when traffic is
# # being denied, rather than simply ignoring it. In these cases, use
# # reject instead of deny. In addition, log rejected connections:
# - community.general.ufw:
#     rule: reject
#     port: auth
#     log: yes
#
# # ufw supports connection rate limiting, which is useful for protecting
# # against brute-force login attacks. ufw will deny connections if an IP
# # address has attempted to initiate 6 or more connections in the last
# # 30 seconds. See  http://www.debian-administration.org/articles/187
# # for details. Typical usage is:
# - community.general.ufw:
#     rule: limit
#     port: ssh
#     proto: tcp
#
# # Allow OpenSSH. (Note that as ufw manages its own state, simply removing
# # a rule=allow task can leave those ports exposed. Either use delete=yes
# # or a separate state=reset task)
# - community.general.ufw:
#     rule: allow
